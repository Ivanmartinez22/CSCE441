I was not able to implement [05 points] - Bounding box is computed correctly
[15 points] - Bounding box is intersected correctly [05 points] - Triangle mesh is loaded properly

I haven't tested Triangle intersection and normal. The ray tracing for the first scene is mostly good but reflecting a little more than it should.
2 days late due to heavy work load. 
Unforntunately I have no more late days.
